Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. 
The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"

2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. 
Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
